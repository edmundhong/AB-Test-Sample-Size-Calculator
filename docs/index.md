## A/B Test Sample Size Calculator

A/B testing, also known as "Split Testing" is an experimental process that often used by Data Scientists or Analysts to determine the better variation of a new implementation. The application is used widely ranging from website design, payment gateway, funnel conversion to workflow enhancement. For this project, we are going to calculate the sample size needed for 50-50 A/B Testing based on several inputs by users.

To calculate the sample size, user will have to fill in the main components of A/B Testing and the script shall calculate the sample size needed for each variation.

### Main Components in A/B Testing 

1. Baseline Conversion Rate - The Baseline Conversion Rate defines the current conversion rate of the implementation that we want to test.
2. Minimum Detectable Effect - The Minimum Detectable Effect would be the lift desired for user to determine and decide that the variation has improved from the existing variation.
3. Significance Threshold - The probability of committing Type I error which is deemed acceptable under the specific circumstances of the test in question.
